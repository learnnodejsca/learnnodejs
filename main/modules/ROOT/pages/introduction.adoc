== Introduction

=== Background

Project http://elderoostalpha.herokuapp.com[“Elderoost”] is a full-stack senior residence application in which users can search, review, and add residence information. It was created with intention of providing useful information about a specific retirement home for future residents. Moreover, there was an aim that the application would provide a safe space for residents of these senior residences to review their living environments. Some of the general requirements that I created for this project :

* [*] Node.js
* [*] PostgreSQL database
* [*] SEO optimized
* [*] Responsive design
* [*] Fast loading times
* [*] JavaScript codebase
* [*] Minimum dependencies
* [*] Interactive maps
* [*] Legible font
* [*] Handlebars templates
* [*] Fast search
* [*] User accounts
* [*] Administrative Dashboard
* [*] Comments
* [*] Reviews
* [*] News Articles
* [*] Email notifications

Prior to beginning the project, I created several requirements. First and foremost, I wanted it to be written in JavaScript using Node.js. Next, I wanted to use the PostgreSQL database as my data storage of choice. One of the reasons for selecting PostgreSQL is that it has a wonderful PostGIS extension which makes interacting with geolocation data much easier than other solutions.

The end goal of the application would be to index well in the search engines. This is done primarily through search engine optimization (SEO) work, responsive design, and fast loading times on mobile and on desktop. To stick to these requirements, I made sure to use the minimum amount of  dependencies that I needed in order to run the project.

Moreover, I wanted the actual search to be visual and done via interactions with some sort of a map. The reason for this was simple, when searching for a new residence I wanted the user to search by area first and other information second. Map interface when it comes to searching by geographical area comes natural.

I wanted to provide to the user a secondary way of searching that was not reliant on a map. Thus, Elderoost should retrieve residence entities through textual search means and not visual alone. Next, I wanted to ensure that there were secure user accounts. This decision was two fold : (1) I wanted to keep the data and not offload it to a 3rd party social login solution, and (2) I wanted to obtain email addresses of users such that I could notify them of product updates. Thus, I also had a requirement that there would be automated notifications to the users via email.

Finally, the project should maintain some sort of an administrative dashboard to manage all of the data. Therefore, there needed to be some kind of roles implementation for authorization part of the application. A regular user shouldn’t be able to access this dashboard.

I hope that you can see similarities of this project that could be transferred to your daily JavaScript workings. Features, such as secure user accounts, are useful and are required in many modern applications.

=== Users

Prior to going through the code, I wanted to go through the three different users in the application and their individual use cases. This provided me some guidance during the building phase of the project. 

.User use cases design
image::users-usecases.png[]

Elderoost has three types of users : (1) a guest user, (2) registered user, and (3) an admin user. I wanted the guest to use the application but be directed towards creating an account and opening an array of features once they did that. However, I understood that not everyone wants to create an account so I wanted to leave some core features available for the guest. I wanted them to be able to browse the content and to search through the content. Beyond these two tasks, the guest user should be directed to creating an account feature.

Once a user registered, they are opened up to the “default feature” list that I show in the graphic above. Besides the typical user management, the user has the ability to add more data to our project. This decision to force user accounts was made to minimize the amount of spam and increase value when compared to a guest user account.

An admin user would then have access to all of the features of the guest user and a regular user, with the added benefit of an added administrative dashboard. In the dashboard, I wanted the user to have control over the residences and news articles. However, it did not make sense to allow admin users to create reviews or submit them on someone else’s behalf. Also, the control of the users would be done solely by interacting with the database. I did not want to build an interface for this entity.

=== Architecture

One of the requirements for project Elderoost was to maintain the dependency list to a minimum.

.Project Elderoost application architecture overview
image::overall-architecture-screen.png[Project Elderoost application architecture overview, align="center"]

Let’s take a look at the overall application architecture. I can do that through the analysis of the packages that are required to run everything. Node.js shines in the composition of different modules that bring the overall application to life. This, also, means that you have to be careful in the packages that you pick and ensure that you don’t pick an old and outdated package.

In the image above, I grouped some of the modules by their function in the application. Let’s take a look at the modules and see where each one fits in

express::
Application server responsible for our app's functionality

path::
Core node.js module that allows us to specify locations within our project

cookie-parser::
Parse cookies

generate-password::
Used to generate secure password reset token

client-sessions::
Module used for creation of `session` object to maintain user data and maintenance of encrypted cookie

bcrypt::
Used to encrypt password into a hash

hbs::
Handlebars templating engine that allows us to create views using hbs templating language

morgan::
Helps with logging

helmet::
Improves security of our application

sendgrid/mail::
Sends emails to our users

sequelize::
Module responsible for interactions with our database of choice

pg::
PostgreSQL connector

pg-hstore::
PostgreSQL connector

csurf::
Module responsible for CSRF protection and adding csrf token to our request object

sitemap::
Module responsible for generating a proper sitemap which is then submitted to the search engines

=== Folder Structure

If we take a look at how node.js application works along with the express framework, we can see a close resemblance to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[model-view-controller] (MVC) model. Thus, the basic idea about the project’s file structure is around the MVC architecture. It feels natural to structure the project this way.

.Node.js app simplified
image::folder-structure-screen.png[width=250, float="right", align="center"]

When a client opens up a web browser and types in the app’s URL, our express web-server catches the request and passes on to its router object. Here in the process express framework does a check if the URL is good and we can proceed, or it is a bad URL and an error is spit back out to the user. The diagram on the left assumes a correct user-flow.

The router then looks at the appropriate route handler to pass on the request. In our case, our route handlers are conveniently located in the `/routes` folder of the project.

From the router handler, our app can interact with our models that are located in our database and then pass this data on to the handlebars view. However, the handler doesn’t necessarily interact with our models and it can just send a response with a specific handlebars view.

And finally, the response is sent to the client.

Within our project, then JavaScript code that is pertinent to interacting with models is placed in the `/models` folder; code that is the core business logic, is placed in the `/routes` folder; and our views are placed in the `/views` folder.

The finished folder structure looks like this :

[source,bash]

=== Templates

Project Elderoost uses https://handlebarsjs.com/[handlebars] (hbs) templating language for displaying its HTML content. Handlebars is super easy to learn and get a hang off. It is one of the choices among several for the express viewing engine. I wont focus on the specifics and leave that up to you for some play. However, I believe that by going through the book and looking at the sample code you will be able to get the gist of the language without needing to look elsewhere.

The way that the templates work is that there is a generic `layout.hbs` file which handles the overall template for your application. This is where you would insert your `html`, `css`, or `javascript` import script statements. The actual, default, location for views that will be displayed using this `layout.hbs` is located in the `views` folder.

The templates themselves are written in the handlebars templating language which is basically a superset of HTML. Each template file ends in `.hbs` file extension. For example, `views/index.hbs` is the main screen for the project. 

The main take away for the hbs templating language is that it uses curly braces `{{ somevariable }}` to evaluate javascript in its code. For example, suppose the following function is supposed to render a residence template and I set a variable that will be accessible in a template. To do this, simply pass on your variable as an object to the `res.render` function, like so : 

.route.js
[source,js]
----
async function (req,res,next) {
  const id = req.id;
  const residence = await Residence.findOne({where: {id: `id`}}); <1>
  const data = { residence: residence };

  res.render('residence', data);
}
----
<1> I assume that the residence object in the code above has address property that tells you where the residence is located. 

Then, in your `residence.hbs` template file, you would simply catch the javascript object and unwrap its value to be used however you want. For example, suppose we just want to catch the variable and print the residence’s address property. I would do it like so :

.residence.hbs
[source,html]
----
<p> Residence is located at {{residence.address}} </p>
----

And the code above would generate HTML output with the value that is set on our residence object’s address property. Simple!

The other two useful demonstrations of the templating language would be : (1) conditionals and (2) loops. https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html[Conditionals] only execute the code if the variable in the expression is available to the template and are executed like so :

.residence.hbs
[source,html]
----
{{#if residence}}
<p> Residence is located at {{residence.address}} </p>
{{/endif}}
----

When working with loops, when you have a collection of data, the syntax is a bit different and looks like so :

.residence.hbs
[source,html]
----
{{#each residences as |residence|}}
<p> Residence is located at {{address}} </p>
{{/each}}
----

The difference lies in the fact that you don’t need to prepend _residence_ object to the evaluating expression. Simply pass in the appropriate property that you want displayed.

The last thing that I want to cover is the two types of templates that typically exist in a project. Dynamic There are two types of templates in the project : (1) static content that rarely changes, and (2) dynamic content that gets generated per request.

==== views/layout.hbs

In addition to the <<seo.adoc#layout-head,head>> code that I insert into my layout, I also add the following main navigation section that looks different depending on the type of the user and whether or not the user is logged in. It looks something like this:

[#layout-navigation]

For this file we first begin by loading the dependencies to constructing our leaflet map. In our project it is a combination of provided library code and external calls. Feel free to modify this code as you wish just ensure the library versions are the same. I noticed at one point that some libraries do not jive well if some libraries are running on the latest everything. I recommend using the libraries provided with this book. The code looks like :

What follows next is a conditional code block that displayes latest residence updates, if there are any to display. When is a case that there is nothing to display? If you are using a custom query or if it is a brand new project =) Otherwise, it is just a precaution and the code looks like this :

<1> In the code above we bind on click events that activate the buttons for each province click. `e` is the identifier for our map; `setView` is the function that changes where the map will be changed its view to based on input of `[53.55,-113.994],6` or an array and a number. Whenever a user clicks on the province short code, the map changes the location based on the coordinates provided above. Thus, this code show you how to interact with a map using external html elements like a button.

We finish off the template with a link to our residences in a list manner, in a table view; like so :

=== Forms

I am going to assume for the duration of the project that you are aware about one of the most common security flaws for a website : cross site request forgery (csrf).footnote:[see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery or https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf] In order to mitigate this attack, we are going to use the `csurf` node.js module. We first add it in our `routes/users.js` file like so

.routes/users.js
[source,js]
----
...
const csrf = require('csurf'); // <1>
const csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true }); // <2>
...
----
<1> import the csurf module
<2> set the token mechanism to be initialized and to be ready to be passed along via cookies

Then, we simply focus on how to use it. We need to use the `csrfProtection` function in our routers as needed. 

* case one:
+
for `get` router handlers, by adding `csrfProtection` function handler gives the request object `csrfToken()` function that passes on a csrf token to be used by a form.
* case two:
+
for `post` router handlers, `csrfProtection` function ensures that the csrf token matches from the form data. If the token does not match, then the router handler throws an error and everything stops.

.Case one : `get` router in routes/users.js
[source,js]
----
...
router.get('/signin', csrfProtection, (req, res, next) => { <1>
  res.render('users/sign-in', {
    title: `Login - Elderoost`,
    csrfToken: req.csrfToken(), <2>
  });
});
...
----
<1> Attach `csrfProtection` to the `/signin` `get` route
<2> Pass `csrfToken` variable to the `views/users/sign-in.hbs` template to be used as a hidden input in a form

.Case two : `post` router in routes/users.js
[source,js]
----
...
router.post('/signin', csrfProtection, async (req, res, next) => { <1>
  const { email, password } = req.body;
...
----
<1> By attaching `csrfProtection` route handler, this router handler now expects a csrf token to be passed along with other information

Moving forward I will assume that you will understand where the csrf token is coming from in various sections of the application.
